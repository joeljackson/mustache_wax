= mustache_wax

Automatically compiles *.html.mustache view files in app/views to /javascripts/mustache_templates.js

== Installation with bundler

In your Gemfile:

    gem 'mustache_wax'

in your application layout:

    <%= javascript_include_tag 'mustache_templates' %>

If you are using capistrano for deployment, in your deploy.rb, add: 

    require 'mustache_wax/capistrano'

This will automatically compile your .html.mustache files on deploy.

If you are not using capistrano, you'll need to modify your deploy script to run:

    rake mustache:generate_templates

== Usage

Anywhere in javascript, you can now use the mustache_templates variable to reference any template.

If you have a mustache view file named app/views/users/user_profile.html.mustache, you can now reference it
in javascript using:

    mustache_templates['users/user_profile']

eg:

    // render the user object with the template
    var html = Mustache.to_html(mustache_templates['users/user_profile'], user_object);

== Compiling in development

You can trigger this manually with "rake mustache:generate_templates", but that shouldn't be necessary. Rails 2 & 3 will automatically recompile the templates on server start (and with passenger, on file change)
